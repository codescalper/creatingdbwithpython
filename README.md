# creatingdbwithpython
This is a repository for creating database in python.
Here first we create a connection between IDE and mysql by using mysql.connector
same goes for creating a cursor.Then we can try creating a table by using cur.execute() and we can use same things for 
filling the values.There might be error in syntax as it depends on the version of mysql so check the documentation for that.

After creating table you can try to fetch the rows by using while loop or for loop depends on you.
And the last thing you have to do is close cursor and connection by using this syntax cur.close()  , conn.close()

(will correct  the error later)
